# Rock_paper_scissors_game
A very nice small game made using python. Here the user can select rock, paper or scissors and will be playing with the computer. The computer chooses any of the three randomly and if it matches then a tie is created.
If user chooses rock and computer uses scissors then user wins. Similarly if user chooses paper or scissors, computer chooses rock or paper respectively then the user wins.
In all other cases computer wins.
Used emojis to represent rock, paper and scissors.
